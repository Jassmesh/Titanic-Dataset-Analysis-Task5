# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis-Task5
Performed  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset and found useful insights from the dataset using python

## Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, including details like passenger class, age, sex, fare, and whether they survived or not. The goal of this project is to explore the data, understand the key patterns, and draw insights from it.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found on Kaggle.

## Data Features:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.

Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).

Name: Name of the passenger.

Sex: Gender of the passenger (male/female).

Age: Age of the passenger in years.

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.

Ticket: Ticket number.

Fare: Fare paid by the passenger.

Cabin: Cabin number.

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

## EDA Process
Data Loading: Load the Titanic dataset and examine the initial structure.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and irrelevant columns.

Data Visualization: Use various visualization techniques (like histograms, bar charts, and box plots) to explore the relationships between features and survival.

Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlations between different features to uncover patterns that might influence survival.

Conclusion: Summarize the insights and key findings from the data exploration.

## Key Insights
Distribution of survival rates by gender, class, age, etc.

Identification of the most influential features on survival.

Understanding of missing values and their treatment.
